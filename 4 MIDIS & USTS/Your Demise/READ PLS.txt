The parts labeled beginning are for the first part of your demise! (the black screen) because the other parts
are NOT in sync with the beginning, so I fixed it with another UST.

Boyfriend (only a) is just a, and that is what I used for Nene. For Parts with more vowels, check out Boyfriend (Tuned)

Monika is tuned!

enjoy ^^
