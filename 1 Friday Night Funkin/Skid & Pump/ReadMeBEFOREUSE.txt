The reason of the names of the samples being like this is for a cause.

If you wanna use both Skid & Pump Seperately, UTAU Pump Samples are named

Pa, Pi & Pu.

It's the sample name but with P at the beginning indicading Pump.

Skid is the same, but with S.

This is so that if you want, you can use them seperately. Or both together for transitions.

This might help with it cuz both of them cannot be named "a" or "e" at once for example.

It will just make the other one "a (2)" or something.

So "S" is to represent SKID.

And "P" is to represent PUMP.

Hopefully this will help if your confused.

Also,

Both of them have A and I vocals.

But Skid has an O Vocal.
Pump has a U Vocal.
Neither of them have an E Vocal.

Skid is sampled from South
Pump is sampled from Spookeez 

(I THINK)

So yeah, hope this helps.
